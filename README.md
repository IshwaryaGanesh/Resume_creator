# Resume_creator

This project aims to provide suggestions to improve and score a resume based on the profile. The scorer works on reducing points from 100 depending on the errors produced.
PRD:
1. Allow the python server to read a docx format file only. The font must be Calibri for now.
2. Separate the headings, content under each heading accordingly.
3. Note spelling errors first. Each spelling error will be counted and reduce the highest weight of points.
4. Grammatical errors next in line.
